## Deployment

To manage the source code history, Git, a version control system, has been utilized. GitHub, one of the most popular hosting services for Git repositories, was chosen. Creating an account is quick and straightforward. Additionally, GitHub provides a service called GitHub Pages, allowing the source code of a project to be linked. This enables the remote presentation of project results to end-users. This is an ideal solution for this project, as it is being carried out for a business operating internationally. Furthermore, changes to the source code are practically visible to end-users with minimal delays.

Procedure for implementing the source code into GitHub Pages:

1. Log in to GitHub at https://github.com.
2. Navigate to the project repository. Usually, after logging in, it should be visible in the "Top Repositories" section without the need for further navigation. If not, repositories can always be viewed by clicking on avatar and selecting the "Your repositories" option"

3. After selecting the repository, find the settings button and go to the Pages tab

4. Make sure the source section is marked “deploy from a branch” and branch to “main” in the root folder. Press the “Save” button.
