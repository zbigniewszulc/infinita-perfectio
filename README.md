# Infinita Perfectio Overview

The Infinita Perfectio website was designed for a Polish dental clinic with an aim of advertising the clinic and attracting international customers. While browsing the website, a potential customer will learn about the history of the clinic and what dental treatments are offered at the clinic. In a very clear way, the website presents the advantages of obtaining dental treatments in Poland and the prices of specific treatments. The customer also has the opportunity of sending an inquiry via the Contact Us form available on the website.

## Deployment

To manage the source code history, Git, a version control system, has been utilized. GitHub, one of the most popular hosting services for Git repositories, was chosen. Creating an account is quick and straightforward. Additionally, GitHub provides a service called GitHub Pages, allowing the source code of a project to be linked. This enables the remote presentation of project results to end-users. This is an ideal solution for this project, as it is being carried out for a business operating internationally. Furthermore, changes to the source code are practically visible to end-users with minimal delays.

Procedure for implementing the source code into GitHub Pages:

1. Log in to GitHub at https://github.com.
2. Navigate to the project repository. Usually, after logging in, it should be visible in the "Top Repositories" section without the need for further navigation. If not, repositories can always be viewed by clicking on avatar and selecting the "Your repositories" option"

3. After selecting the repository, find the settings button and go to the Pages tab

4. Make sure the source section is marked “deploy from a branch” and branch to “main” in the root folder. Press the “Save” button.

5. That's it. After waiting a while for the project hosting service to be created, a link to the project should appear.

## Credits
### Content

Page content has been partially provided by the clinic owner and partially authored by me. The owner supplied substantive content, while I focused on constructing the section highlighting the benefits of medical tourism. This approach was chosen for several reasons: a short project timeline, the owner's limited time to provide all materials, and my personal experience with medical tourism, including dental tourism. In such a case, it is easier for the owner to edit a previously prepared text. This not only allows for easy modification but also opens up the possibility of refining the project overview and tailoring it to specific needs.

The content provided by the clinic owner is based on an existing website addressed to local patients - https://www.implanty-bielsko.pl
