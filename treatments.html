        <h1>Genral Dentistry </h1>
        <p>General dentistry is a field that focuses on the prevention and treatment of tooth decay. The most
            common causes of tooth decay are primarily the consumption of a high-sugar diet, bacteria, and a lack of
            proper oral hygiene.

            The treatment of tooth decay involves the thorough removal of the "decayed" hard tissues of the tooth and
            the application of a filling that restores the lost part of the tooth. According to global standards, we use
            modern fillings such as porcelain, composite (micro and nanohybrid), and glass-ionomer from reputable
            companies. These materials have a wide range of colors and high mechanical strength, allowing us to
            faithfully and naturally reconstruct a damaged tooth. Thanks to the effective local anesthetics we use,
            these procedures are minimally discomforting for patients.</p>
        <h2>Dental Hygiene</h2>
        <p>Dental hygiene is a field aimed at preventing oral diseases, especially tooth decay and periodontal
            diseases. When effectively conducted, it helps avoid prolonged and costly tooth treatments.

            Its primary task is to combat dental plaque, the main cause of oral issues.

            The guarantee of the effectiveness of preventive measures is the continuous collaboration between the
            patient and the dental office. Daily hygiene practices, adherence to recommendations, and regular visits to
            the hygiene office allow one to enjoy a beautiful, healthy smile throughout life.

            Regular check-up visits every 6 months enable the early detection and treatment of oral diseases, as well as
            the performance of professional hygiene procedures, including:

            Oral hygiene instructions, taking into account the patient's individual needs, selection of brushing
            methods, and hygiene accessories.
            Professional teeth cleaning:
            Scaling: removal of mineralized dental plaque using ultrasonic devices.
            Sandblasting: removal of deposits and discolorations using a sandblaster.
            Polishing: smoothing the cleaned surfaces of the teeth.
            Fluoridation: the application of fluoride-containing preparations promotes enamel remineralization and
            strengthening, prevents tooth decay, and alleviates sensitivity.</p>
        <h2>Endodontics</h2>
        <p>Endodontics deals with the diagnosis and treatment of pulp diseases in teeth and periapical tissues. Root
            canal treatment (endodontic treatment) is necessary when dead tissue or bacteria cause inflammation in
            the tooth chamber and root canals. The treating dentist thoroughly cleans and disinfects the tooth, and
            then fills the canals with an appropriate material. Remember! If pain or swelling occurs, it is crucial
            to react promptly</p>
        <h2>Prosthodontics</h2>
        <p>Prosthodontics deals with the reconstruction of lost tooth tissues using crowns, bridges, dentures, and
            implants. It also improves the aesthetic, cosmetic, and psychological impression of the patient. After the
            loss of natural teeth or extensive damage, prosthodontic treatment often becomes the last 'lifeline' for
            maintaining and extending a youthful appearance and radiant smile.

            With the experience and knowledge I possess, I can offer my patients various options for filling gaps or
            imperfections in their dentition. Together, we determine a detailed plan and the stages of treatment.

            We specialize in comprehensive prosthodontic treatment.</p>
        <h2>Dental Implants</h2>
        <p>Implantology is an ideal, nature-mimicking therapy that allows for the permanent restoration of missing
            teeth. It is possible to replace any lost tooth. Teeth lost due to accidents, periodontal disease, cavities,
            unsuccessful root canal treatment, or ineffective root apex resection can be replaced with an implant and a
            prosthetic crown. This ensures excellent aesthetic results and a natural appearance of the dentition,
            providing the patient with complete physical and psychological comfort, and avoiding issues associated with
            traditional prosthetic replacements, such as removable dentures or the need to grind healthy teeth.</p>
        <h2>Dental Surgery</h2>
        <p>Dental surgery is a medical specialty aimed at supporting other fields of dentistry, such as endodontics
            (root
            canal treatment), orthodontics, periodontics (treatment of gum diseases), and prosthodontics. Procedures
            within its scope require a high level of precision. They are performed under local anesthesia, and if
            necessary, under general anesthesia. With a focus on the safety, health, and comfort of our patients, all
            oral surgery procedures are conducted using top-quality equipment and materials in the comfortable
            conditions of our clinic.</p>
