                    <h1>General Dentistry</h1>
                </div>
                <p>
                    General dentistry is a field that focuses on the prevention and treatment of tooth decay. The most
                    common causes of tooth decay are primarily the consumption of a high-sugar diet, bacteria, and a
                    lack of
                    proper oral hygiene.
                    The treatment of tooth decay involves the thorough removal of the "decayed" hard tissues of the
                    tooth
                    and
                    the application of a filling that restores the lost part of the tooth. According to global
                    standards, we
                    use
                    modern fillings such as porcelain, composite (micro and nanohybrid), and glass-ionomer from
                    reputable
                    companies. These materials have a wide range of colors and high mechanical strength, allowing us to
                    faithfully and naturally reconstruct a damaged tooth. Thanks to the effective local anesthetics we
                    use,
                    these procedures are minimally discomforting for patients.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Daily hygiene practices, adherence to recommendations, and regular
                    visits
                    to
                    the hygiene office allow one to enjoy a beautiful, healthy smile throughout life.
                    Regular check-up visits every 6 months enable the early detection and treatment of oral diseases, as
                    well as
                    the performance of professional hygiene procedures, including:
                    Oral hygiene instructions, selection of brushing
                    methods, and hygiene accessories.
                    Professional teeth cleaning:
                    Scaling: removal of mineralized dental plaque using ultrasonic devices.
                    Sandblasting: removal of deposits and discolorations using a sandblaster.
                    Polishing: smoothing the cleaned surfaces of the teeth.
                    Fluoridation: the application of fluoride-containing preparations promotes enamel remineralization
                    and
                    strengthening, prevents tooth decay, and alleviates sensitivity.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Endodontics is a dental specialty focused on diagnosing and treating diseases of the dental pulp and
                    tissues surrounding
                    the tooth roots. Commonly known as root canal treatment, endodontic procedures involve removing
                    infected or damaged
                    pulp, cleaning and shaping the root canals, and sealing them to prevent further infection. This
                    specialty aims to save
                    natural teeth by addressing issues such as tooth decay, trauma, or infections that affect the
                    innermost part of the
                    tooth. Endodontists use advanced techniques, including microscopic and digital technologies, to
                    perform precise and
                    effective treatments. Successful endodontic care alleviates pain, preserves natural teeth, and
                    contributes to overall
                    oral health.

                <p>
                    Prosthodontics deals with the reconstruction of lost tooth tissues using crowns, bridges, dentures,
                    and
                    implants. It also improves the aesthetic, cosmetic, and psychological impression of the patient.
                    After
                    the
                    loss of natural teeth or extensive damage, prosthodontic treatment often becomes the last 'lifeline'
                    for
                    maintaining and extending a youthful appearance and radiant smile.
                    With the experience and knowledge I possess, I can offer my patients various options for filling
                    gaps or
                    imperfections in their dentition. Together, we determine a detailed plan and the stages of
                    treatment.
                    We specialize in comprehensive prosthodontic treatment.

                <p>
                    Implantology is an ideal, nature-mimicking therapy that allows for the permanent restoration of
                    missing
                    teeth. It is possible to replace any lost tooth. Teeth lost due to accidents, periodontal disease,
                    cavities,
                    unsuccessful root canal treatment, or ineffective root apex resection can be replaced with an
                    implant
                    and a
                    prosthetic crown. This ensures excellent aesthetic results and a natural appearance of the
                    dentition,
                    providing the patient with complete physical and psychological comfort, and avoiding issues
                    associated
                    with
                    traditional prosthetic replacements, such as removable dentures or the need to grind healthy teeth.
